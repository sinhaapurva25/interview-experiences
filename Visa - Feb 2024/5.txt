Consider a Hive database with two tables: Sales and Products.
The Sales table has the following fields:
SaleID (integer)
ProductID (integer)
SaleDate (date)
Quantity (integer)
Price (float)
The Products table has the following fields:
ProductID (integer)
ProductName (string)
Category (string)
Write a Hive SQL query to find out the top 5 products (ProductName) that have generated the most revenue (Quantity * Price) in the 'Electronics' category for the year 2020. Include the product name and the total revenue in your result.

val joined_table = Sales.(products, Sales("ProductID") === Products("ProductID"), "inner")
val filtered = joined_table.filter(x = > joined_table('Category')==Electronics)
val res1 = spark.sql("select ProductName, (Quantity*Price) as price from filtered group by 'SaleDate' orderBy desc price limit 5")
val res1 = spark.sql("select ProductName, (Quantity*Price) as price from filtered group by 'SaleDate' orderBy price")
