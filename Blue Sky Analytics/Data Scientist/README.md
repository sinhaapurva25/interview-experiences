## Challenge
The COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting social distancing recommendations and related restrictions have led to numerous short-term changes in economic and social activity around the world, all of which may have impacts on our environment. Your challenge is to use space-based data combined with ground observations and document all the environmental changes caused by COVID-19 and the associated societal responses. 

For example, a decline in air pollution and other emissions may be linked to reduced transportation, commuting needs, and reduction in industrial activities. Also, studies reveal a reduction in air pollution in areas with reduced economic activity. 

Your goal is to use space-based satellite data combined with ground observations like air pollution, social-economic activity, traffic or transportation, mobility, industrial activity perform exploratory data analysis, find a correlation between changes in ground activities and their impact on the environment. Compare data across different time periods and geographic regions and explore changes in Earth-related attributes (such as land use, land cover, and other characteristics) in response to COVID-19?

## Consideration

1. Your solution may focus on any type or combination of environmental phenomena (e.g., atmosphere, land, ocean, water, ice, fire), attributes, and locations. You may consider these attributes in your solution (but you are not limited to these examples)
    - Changes in air quality ( due to reduced transportation & economic activities)
    - Wildfires events
    - Deforestation
    - Urban growth
    - Water Quality
2. For the solution any type of geographic location is suitable. Clearly define the region of interest for your solution. 
3. Make sure to clearly state what data you used and how you used it.
4. For solutions involving machine learning clearly state the evaluation stage, metrics used, and validation set.
5. How would you determine if observed environmental phenomena are impacts of the COVID- 19 pandemics?
6. Which impact dynamics can be discovered on a local or regional basis?
7. Identify links among various environmental and anthropogenic activities in your solution.
8. Present your assumptions, theories, and solution with necessary correlation or causal relationships.

## Summary Report

Besides your solution provide a document answering all the below-mentioned questions

1. Summary of your solution. 
2. Key outcomes or takeaways from your solutions.
3. How did your solution involve geospatial data?
4. Does your solution require improvements in terms of data or methodology?
