I once asked my Microsoft manager why they hired me.


They said it was because I asked a lot of questions during the interview.

I didn't take it as a compliment at the time...

But now I see recruiters speaking about the importance of asking questions during the interview.

At this point, it's common sense to come to interviews ready with questions.

Here are some categories of questions you can ask:

1. The Role

- "What should this role accomplish in the first month, 3 months, and year?"

- "Why is this role open?" (Was it just created? Did the previous worker leave? Was the previous person promoted?)

2. The Team

- "Does your team do team bonding events?"

-"How often does the team give each other updates on their work?"

3. The Manager

-"How do you help develop members of your team?"

-"What is your/your manager's teaching style like?"

4. The Company

- "What measures does the company take to ensure diversity and inclusion?"

-"How often do you interact with people from other departments?"

5. The Interviewer

-"How did you choose to work for this company?"

-"Are you involved in any company activities outside of work?"

The interviewers asked you hard questions, so don't be afraid to ask them good questions too!
