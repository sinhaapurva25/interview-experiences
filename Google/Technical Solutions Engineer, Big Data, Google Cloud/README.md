# Technical Solutions Engineer, Big Data, Google Cloud (18th Aug 2022)

#### I applied online and recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn

## Application
1. I applied online for [Technical Solutions Engineer, Big Data, Google Cloud](https://github.com/sinhaapurva25/interview-experiences/blob/main/Technical%20Solutions%20Engineer,%20Big%20Data,%20Google%20Cloud/README.md#jd) and forgot about it until the day of the interview.
2. 20 days later the Google Foobar challenge fired up in my browser. So I got on to solving that.
3. A week later a Google recruiter hit me up on LinkedIn for another role, therefore asking for my CV. I mailed it to them, but got no response. So I thought perhaps the deal's over, and forgot about it.
4. Two weeks later, another Google recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn for the same role I have mentioned in #1. I gave them my contact number and we had a brief 10 minutes call where they explained the job role and also understood my working history and experience. They scheduled a 20-minutes interview with me for the next morning.

## In the Interview
1. Don't switch on your video unless you're asked to. If they need it, they will tell you.
2. Keep talking and communicating, you don't know how it might be just useful.
3. I have shared the coding round question and the Hadoop questions in the sub-folders.

## Takeaways
1. The recruiter told me I didn't perform well at all in the coding round, which is really needed for this position.
2. Also I need to brush up on my Linux a bit.
3. They said I should prepare for another 2-3 months and they will connect with me after that time period.
